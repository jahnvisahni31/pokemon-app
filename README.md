# Pokémon App

A simple React application that allows users to browse a list of Pokémon, search for specific Pokémon, and view detailed information about each Pokémon using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## About

The Pokémon App leverages the PokéAPI to fetch Pokémon data and present it in a user-friendly interface built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. Users can easily navigate through Pokémon, search for their favorites, and learn more about their abilities, height, weight, and other characteristics.

## Features

- **Pokémon List**: Displays a list of Pokémon fetched from the PokéAPI.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for Pokémon by name with debounce functionality for better performance.
- **Detailed View**: Click on any Pokémon to view its detailed information, including abilities, height, weight, base experience, and cries.
- **Back Navigation**: Easily navigate back to the Pokémon list from the details view.
